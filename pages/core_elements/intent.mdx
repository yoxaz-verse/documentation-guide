## 💡 How to Use This Framework

1. **Identify the dominant intent** from what the lead says.
2. **Tag** it in CRM or lead sheet.
3. **Respond** with the right value proposition or feature.
4. **Prioritize** by urgency — fear/survival > profit > vision.
5. **Feed insights back** to marketing to refine campaigns.

---

> ✅ **Pro Tip:** Every conversation reveals at least one _dominant intent_. Your job as a salesperson is to listen for _why_ the user wants the platform — not just _what_ they’re asking for.
